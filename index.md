### Hobbies
1. [Fishing](https://res.cloudinary.com/simpleview/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,q_65,w_768/v1/clients/norway/Fishing_2152634f-ba23-4044-8145-6ec3bab642bf.png)
- My favorite places to fish is [The Guadalupe River](https://tpwd.texas.gov/fishboat/fish/management/stocking/guadalupe.phtml) because it is only about 35 minutes from my parents' house, and its the southernmost body of water to have a sustainable Rainbow Trout ecosystem
- The Canyon Lake Dam is so high that the water coming from the bottom is cold enough to provide the trout with oxygen. 
- Rainbow trout are easily scared, so they are challenging to catch
- Wading up and down the river is peaceful and I want my ashes scattered in the Guadalupe River when I die
2. [Spurs Basketball](https://basketballhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hi-res-159737409_crop_650x440.jpg)
- The Spurs have been deemed "offensively challenged" by most sports commentators, but let me **LEARN** you something here.  Our MVP, Kawhi Leonard, has missed like 30 games this season with a quad injury.  
- Rudy Gay, who we recruited solely for his offensive presence, has missed the past like 15 games. 
- We have had to rotate our bench players in constantly
- Pop may or may not be obsessed with defense. 
3. [Overwatch](https://d1u1mce87gyfbn.cloudfront.net/media/screenshot/widowmaker-screenshot-004.jpg)
- This [Article](http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1325069-overwatch) poses extreme controversy in the Overwatch Community
4. Going to Northgate
- My friends and I like to play games at The Backyard
- The Dry Bean Saloon is a cool shot bar
- You will find me singing karoake occasionally
